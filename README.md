# pythonFishingBot
This script can fish for you in Terraria and Minecraft. Under Linux, the Terraria bot hasn't yet been implemented.

Windows Requirements:
  - opencv-python
  - pywin32
  - numpy
  - scikit-image

Linux Requirements:
  - opencv-python
  - pyautogui
  - numpy
  - scikit-image

How to make it work:
  - place the cursor over the point where the hook will go
  - open the terminal and type "python main.py"
  - refocus the game window and you're done

From now on, the bot will fish for you.
To stop it, focus the terminal again and press Enter.
